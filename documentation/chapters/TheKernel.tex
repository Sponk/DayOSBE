\chapter{The Kernel}

\section{Introduction}
The DayOS kernel is a micro kernel that only contains the bare minimum needed to manage the
computers resources by only providing basic primitives for memory management, Inter
Process Communication (IPC) and process management.
Every process runs as a "usermode" non-privileged program without the power to bring down the whole system
on a crash. This even holds for driver processes and essential services like the 
Virtual File System (VFS) or the kernel process.
